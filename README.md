# graphPINN
A message-passing based PINN for emulating magnetohydrostatic models built on a graph-convolutional framework.

This work is ongoing, but a link will be posted to the arXiv paper for this Physics-Informed Neural Net as soon as it exists; watch this space! In the mean time, check out the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111214) and [code](https://github.com/apt-get-nat/RBF-MHS) for the scattered-note Magnetohydrostatic model this PINN is being trained to emulate. The dataset that was generated to train this PINN is currently being revised for publication. You can learn about downloading it for yourself [here](https://parse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with the caution that it is an early access product not yet ready for general scientific use.
