# graphPINN
A message-passing based PINN for emulating magnetohydrostatic models built on a graph-convolutional framework as per https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2003.03485

This work is ongoing, but a link will be posted to the arXiv paper for this Physics-Informed Neural Net as soon as it exists; watch this space! In the mean time, check out the scattered-note Magnetohydrostatic model this PINN is being trained to emulate at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111214
