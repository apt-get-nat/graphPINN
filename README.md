# graphPINN
A message-passing based PINN for emulating magnetohydrostatic models built on a graph-convolutional framework. See the AGU poster for more information: http://agu2022fallmeeting-agu.ipostersessions.com/Default.aspx?s=DD-14-A6-2B-20-A2-07-93-67-66-15-A2-2A-F9-50-38

This work is ongoing, but a link will be posted to the arXiv paper for this Physics-Informed Neural Net as soon as it exists; watch this space! In the mean time, check out the scattered-note Magnetohydrostatic model this PINN is being trained to emulate at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111214

This model was heavily inspired by the methodology in https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2003.03485
